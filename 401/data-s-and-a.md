# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Discussion Questions

1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

    - What type of data am a using
    - How am I going to store this data
    - How much data am I planning on storing
2. How can we ensure that we’ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

    - You will need to have an exit function.
    - You also need to have a **base case** in order to allow the function to exit the loop.

### Notes

- **Data Structures** are a specialized means of organizing and storing data in computers in such a way that we can perform operations on the stored data more efficiently.
- An **array** is a structure of fixed-size, which can hold items of the same data type. It can be an array of integers, an array of floating-point numbers, an array of strings or even an array of arrays (such as 2-dimensional arrays). Arrays are indexed, meaning that random access is possible.
- A **linked list** is a sequential structure that consists of a sequence of items in linear order which are linked to each other.
- A **stack** is a LIFO (Last In First Out — the element placed at last can be accessed at first) structure which can be commonly found in many programming languages.
- A **queue** is a FIFO (First In First Out — the element placed at first can be accessed at first) structure which can be commonly found in many programming languages.
- A **Hash Table** is a data structure that stores values which have keys associated with each of them. Furthermore, it supports lookup efficiently if we know the key associated with the value. Hence it is very efficient in inserting and searching, irrespective of the size of the data.
- A **tree** is a hierarchical structure where data is organized hierarchically and are linked together. This structure is different from a linked list whereas, in a linked list, items are linked in a linear order.
- A **Heap** is a special case of a binary tree where the parent nodes are compared to their children with their values and are arranged accordingly.
- A **graph** consists of a finite set of vertices or nodes and a set of edges connecting these vertices. The order of a graph is the number of vertices in the graph. The size of a graph is the number of edges in the graph.
