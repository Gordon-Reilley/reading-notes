# Whiteboard Interviews

## Whiteboard Advice

- The Advice: Communicate!
- First, Restate the Question
- restate the problem to make sure you understand it
- Ask about edge cases
- Ask about test cases
- Write pseudocode and ask if it makes sense
- many (most?) interviewers are more interested in how you think than perfect code
- simply being able to reason through the pseudocode is sufficient for many great companies
- Write the actual code and see if it looks good
- Try making it conversational "I’m a bit stuck here, do you have any tips to nudge me in the right direction?”
