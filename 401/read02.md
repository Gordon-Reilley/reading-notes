1. In Tests We Trust - TDD with Python

    - Unit tests are some pieces of code to exercise the input, the output and the behavior of your code. You can write them anytime you want. But Test-Driven Development is a strategy to think (and write!) tests first.
    - There are some details to pay attention. The first one is the test name. The tests can be considered as your alive documentation. We need to be descriptive about it and to say what is expected and what we are testing.
    - The test file name should follow the same name of module name.
    - Other thing to care about is the structure. A convention widely used is the AAA: Arrange, Act and Assert.

      - Arrange: you need to organize the data needed to execute that piece of code (input);
      - Act: here you will execute the code being tested (exercise the behaviour);
      - Assert: after executing the code, you will check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting.
    - The cycle is made by three steps:

      - Write a unit test and make it fail (it needs to fail because the feature isn’t there, right? If this test passes, call the Ghostbusters, really)
      - Write the feature and make the test pass! (you can dance after that)
      - Refactor the code — the first version doesn’t need to be the beautiful one (don’t be shy)
