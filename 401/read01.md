## Readings

1. Pain and Suffering

    - As you work through feeling the pain of growth over the next 10 weeks, consider heavily the story that you attach to it.

      - What’s your perspective?
      - Why are you doing this?
      - Do you want what comes at the end of this journey?
      - Are you doing this for you?
    - As you experience pain, seek the remedy! Ask questions that bridge the gap between what you know and what you need to be able to do. Research! Build your resources and your community! Don’t experience the pain in silence—that slides toward needless pain and the realm of suffering.

    - Find the common thread that makes the pain worthwhile, that puts the pain into perspective. You’re here because you chose to invest in a different life. A better life.

    - You’re in this class so that you can become not just a competent Python developer, but a spectacular craftsman of software with Python as your tool. The pain that you feel? Those are the callouses that you build while learning to use that tool.
2. Beginners Guide to Big O

    - Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.
    - Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.
    - O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.
    - O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.
    - O(N²) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.
    - O(2^N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set.

1. Names and Values in Python

    - Names in Python refer to values.
    - Code is executed from top to bottom of the page.
    - Values live as long as there are references, once all of them are gone the value disappears.
    - Names are reassigned independently
    - Assignment never copies data
