## List Comprehensions

- Three things are necessary for a python list comprehension to work.
  - First is the expression we’d like to carry out. expression inside the square brackets.
  - Second is the object that the expression will work on. item inside the square brackets.
  - Finally, we need an iterable list of objects to build our new list from. list inside the square brackets.
- List comprehension methods are an elegant way to create and manage lists. 
- In Python, list comprehensions are a more compact way of creating lists. 
- More flexible than for loops, list comprehension is usually faster than other methods.
- List comprehensions reduce the code necessary to complete rather complicated task when working with a list.
- List comprehensions can make solving issues involving strings much easier using simplified expressions. These methods can save time and precious lines of code.
- Using list comprehension to loop through a string in Python, it’s possible to convert strings from lower case to upper case, and vice versa. 
- It’s also possible to read files in Python using list comprehension.
- Using list comprehension, we can iterate through the lines of text in the file and store their contents in a new list.
- Not only can we write our own functions with list comprehensions, but we can also add filters to better control the statements.
- Writing compact code is essential for maintaining programs and working with teams.
