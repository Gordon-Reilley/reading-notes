# React 1

## Introducing JSX

- A syntax extension to JavaScript

- Example

- const element = `<h1>Hello, world!</h1>`;

- After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects.

- Since JSX is closer to JavaScript than to HTML, React DOM uses camelCase property naming convention instead of HTML attribute names.

- For example, class becomes className in JSX, and tabindex becomes tabIndex.

## Components and Props

- Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces.

- Props which stands for properties

- Propsare read only.

- All react components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.

- Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity

## NEXT.js

- Next.js is a JavaScript framework for building server-rendered or statically-generated web applications. The link above contains a tutorial on Next.js.
- Contained here are the basic steps for getting started with Next.js. The tutorial goes into more detail on each step and provides additional information on how to customize your Next.js app. I just, there has been so much and I still have two videos.
