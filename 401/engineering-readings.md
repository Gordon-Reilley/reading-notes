# Engineering Readings

## Discussion Questions

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

    - Something that I bring is my personality and ability to work with anyone. I am a social person and have the take pride in including everyone I work with and bringing out the best in my co-workers.
2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

    - First I will do trial and error and use my debugging tools to attempt to break the problem down into smaller pieces and knock them out one by one.
    - Second I will turn to the internet and search the problem I am trying to fix in order to hopefully find a helpful solution or direction to head in.
    - Last I will ask myself how long I have been working on this project, and if its been and hour or more with no progress I will know its time to either take a break or ask for help.
