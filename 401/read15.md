# Serverless Functions

## What is serverless?
- Serverless is a cloud computing application development and execution model that enables developers to build and run application code without provisioning or managing servers or backend infrastructure.
- Serverless lets developers put all their focus into writing the best front-end application code and business logic they can. All developers need to do is write their application code and deploy it to containers managed by a cloud service provider.

- The cloud provider is also responsible for all routine infrastructure management and maintenance such as operating system updates and patches, security management, capacity planning, system monitoring and more.
- The name notwithstanding, there are most definitely servers in serverless computing. 'Serverless' describes the developer’s experience with those servers—they are invisible to the developer, who doesn't see them, manage them, or interact with them in any way.
- Function-as-a-service, or FaaS, is a cloud computing service that enables developers to run code or containers in response to specific events or requests, without specifying or managing the infrastructure required to run to code.
- FaaS is the compute model central to serverless, and the two terms are often used interchangeably.
- Because serverless, platform as a service (PaaS), containers, and virtual machines (VMs) all play a critical role in the cloud application development and compute ecosystem, it’s useful to compare how serverless compares to the others across some key attributes.
- Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, management and scaling of containers. Kubernetes' automation dramatically simplifies the development of container-based applications.
- Given all of the preceding, it should be no surprise that serverless computing offers a number of technical and business benefits to individual developers and enterprise development teams.
- Given its unique combination of attributes and benefits, serverless architecture is well-suited for use cases around microservices, mobile backends, and data and event stream processing.

### Things I want to know more about
- PaaS vs. FaaS is something I would need to further investigate as this article only touch on it generally.
