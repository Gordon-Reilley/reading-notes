# Trees

## Vocabulary/Definition List
- Node - A Tree node is a component which may contain its own values, and references to other nodes
- Root - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
- K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.
- Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree
- Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree
- Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
- Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children
- Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf
- Traversal - traversing a tree allows us to search for a node, print out the contents of a tree, and much more
- Depth First - traversal is where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first.
- Breadth First - traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node.
- Binary Trees - restrict the number of children to two.
- K-ary Tree - if Nodes are able have more than 2 child nodes, we call the tree that contains them a K-ary Tree
- Binary Search Tree (BST) - is a type of tree that does have some structure attached to it. In a BST, nodes are organized in a manner where all values that are smaller than the `root` are placed to the left, and all values that are larger than the `root` are placed to the right.

### Things I want to know more about

- I'd like to see these processes in a real scenario to help me better understand them as reading them on paper can be hard to retain.
