# The Coder's Computer

## Text Editor Overview

A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser. The Text Editor enables you to write and edit text/code that you will eventually deploy to a Webpage.

### Choosing a Text Editor

A **Text Editor** is simply a computer program and a tool used for editing plain text. An **IDE**, on the other hand, is a fully integrated software environment that consolidates developer tools required to build and test software. You can do everything that a Text Editor can do plus more, which is why I recommend choosing a popular IDE software like VS code.

#### Terminal Cheat Sheet

- **pwd** shows you where you are currently located.
- **ls** list the contents in the directory of the current location.
- **ls -a** to show all hidden files.
- **mkdir**  make a directory (space then name of folder case sensitive).
- **cd** change directory (name of folder) or hit tab for last folder.
- **touch** create new file (.type)
- **mv** move a file or directory.

- **code .** VS Code will open in whatever directory is selected.
- **tree** visual representation of file structure.
