## GIT Explained

Git is a Distributed Version Control systems **(DVCS)** that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it. Git mostly relies on local operations because most necessary information can be found in local resources. This allows for process expediency because a project’s history resides on the local disk, eliminating the need to fetch history information from the server, and allowing one to continue work on a project even when not online or on a VPN.

### Workflow

- Create/Import a repository
- Clone your repository to create a local copy on your server
- Open your text editor
- Write your Text/code
- **Save your work!**
- A-C-P out to GitHub
- Re-fresh your GitHub pages and bask in what you've accomplished.
