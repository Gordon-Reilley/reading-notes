# Structure of Web Pages with HTML

## Wireframe and Design

**Wireframing** is a way to design a website service at the structural level. A wireframe is commonly used to layout content on a page which takes into account user needs and user path to get places. Wireframes are used early in developmental process to establish the basic structure of a webpage before design and content is added. Basically a rough draft of the ideas you want to implement on your website. This way you have an idea/layout to work off of when starting your project and not wasting time coding things as you go.

### Mozilla HTML Basics

**HTML** stands for **H**yper **T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage. HTML code is used to structure a web page and its content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. HTML uses **tags** to accomplish the changes you want to apply to your webpage, such as paragraphs, resizing text, inserting links/images, ect.

#### Semantics

In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code. In HTML, for example, the **<h1>** element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the meaning of "a top level heading on your page."
