# Markdown Guide

Markdown is a fast, simple, and lightweight way to write code once you learn its syntax. 
Below I will explain why its a great language to utilize when writing code in Markdown.

## _A quick cheat sheet for learning about Markdown._

- Markdown **is not** a WYSIWYG editor like microsoft word or google docs.
- Markdown **is** a markup language that adds syntax to text in order to change the look of said text.
- When you add the Markdown syntax to plaintext you will see it in your Markdown file, but not in the rendered webpage/preview.
- If you see syntax on your webpage after you render it, you most likely made a mistake.
- You may not be able to preview your document depending on the which text editor you use, but you do not need to in Markdown.This is because you can see the changes you make as you make them with your syntax in your file.

For all these reasons Markdown is a great way to take notes and create content for a website in a clean, quick, and concise way!
