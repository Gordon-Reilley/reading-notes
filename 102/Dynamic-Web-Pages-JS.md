# Dynamic Web Pages with Javascript

## What is Javascript

**JavaScript** (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions.  JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.

### History of Javascript

Traditionally JavaScript was used inside web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome, Opera, or Safari. The author would include some JavaScript code in the HTML page the user receives when she visits a web site. That JavaScript code would run in the browser what we call "client side", as opposed to running on the web server which is called "server side".In recent years people have started to put JavaScript code on the server as well. Probably the most well know environment to run JavaScript on the server is Node.js, but there are others.

#### 3 major parts of JS

1. The language itself. This is fairly standard among the various environments, both in the various browsers and in the various server-side environments.
2. The DOM API - how the language can interact with the various parts of a web page while in the browser. While in this respect the various browsers are getting closer to each other they still differ. Several libraries, most prominently JQuery, is trying to provide a unified API.
3. The server API (or just API) provided by Node.js or one of the other server-side systems.
