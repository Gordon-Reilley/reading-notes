# Programming With Javascript

## Control Flow

The **control flow** is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the structures that change the control flow, such as *conditionals* and *loops*. Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

### Javascript Functions

A **JavaScript function** is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A JavaScript function is executed when *"something"* invokes it. A JavaScript function is defined with the function **keyword**, followed by a **name**, followed by **parentheses ()**. Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables). The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...). All of this is followed by **curly brackets {}**.The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets. Function **parameters** are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition. Function **arguments** are the **values** received by the function when it is invoked. Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as *local* variables.

### Javascript Operators

In JavaScript, an **operator** is a special symbol used to perform operations on operands (values and variables).

- **Arithmetic Operators:** are used to perform arithmetic on numbers.
- **Assignment Operators:** assign values to JavaScript variables.
- **Comparison Operators:** are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.
- **Logical Operators:** are used to determine the logic between variables or values.
- **Conditional Operators:** assigns a value to a variable based on some condition.
