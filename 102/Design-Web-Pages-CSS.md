# Design Web Pages w/ CSS

## What is CSS

**Cascading Style Sheets** (CSS) is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users â€” how they are styled, laid out, etc. CSS can be used for very basic document text styling. For example, changing the color and size of headings and links. Basically if **HTML** is the structure of a webpage, **CSS** is the style of that webpage.

### CSS Syntax

CSS is a rule-based language. You define the rules by specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page. You start with a *selector*, then you add *curly brackets*, after you fill those curly brackets with *declarations*. Each declaration will have a form of a *property* and *value* pair. We specify a property before a colon, and we specify a value of the property after the colon. CSS properties have different allowable values, depending on which property is being specified. A CSS stylesheet will contain many such rules, written one after the other.

#### CSS Specifications

All web standards technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) are defined in giant documents called specifications (or "specs"), which are published by standards organizations and define precisely how those technologies are supposed to behave.
