# React and Forms

## React Docs - Forms

1. A **Controlled Component** is when a React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input.
2. We should update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them because then we can give the user instant feedback incase they are doing something incorrect or correct.
3. We target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field by using **onChange**

## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained

1. We would use a ternary operator when we need to use an if statement that compares inputs. 
ex. condition ? value if true : value if false
2. Answer:

```React
x === y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false);
```
