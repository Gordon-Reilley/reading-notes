# Functional Programming

## Functional Programming Concepts

A **pure funtion** returns the same result if givin the same arguments and it does not cause any observable side effects.

3. What are the benefits of a pure function?

The state cannot change after it’s created.

5. What is Referential transparency?

A that function consistently yields the same result for the same input.
