# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding

1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

    - The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers. And these toys were marketed almost entirely to men and boys. This idea that computers are for boys became a narrative.
2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?

    - When parents bought computers for boys as kids by the time they got to college most of the men were way ahead because they'd grown up playing with computers.

## Review the data: Employee breakdown of key technology companies

### Ask the question: Why diversity matters to your tech company

1. When are diversity efforts most successful?

    - Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders.
2. Why do diverse companies perform better?

    - Diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it.
3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.

    - When YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result.
