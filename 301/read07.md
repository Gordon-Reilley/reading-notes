# REST

## How I explained REST to my brother

1. Who is Roy Fielding?

Wrote HTTP, how we access documents on the web

2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

Machines don't have a universal way of talking to each other. Every programming language, database, or other kind of system has a different way of communicating. That's why the URL is so important.

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

HyperText Transfer Protocol and it tells the browser where to look to get documents off of servers and brings them into the user's browser

4. What does a GET do?

GET is used to request data from a specified resource.

5. What does a POST do?

POST is used to send data to a server to create/update a resource.

6. What does PUT do?

PUT completely replaces whatever currently exists at the target URL with something else.

7. What does PATCH do?

PATCH requests updated parts of the resource at the client defined URI
