1. Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

|SQL|NoSQL|
| ----- | ----- |
|table based databases|document based databases|
|predefined schema|dynamic schema for unstructured data|
|vertically scalable|horizontally scalable|
|scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware|scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources|
|uses structured query language|uses unstructured query language|

1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

    - Complex query intensive environment
2. Give a real world example.

    - MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. NoSQL
3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

    - Best fit for hierarchical data storage.
4. Give a real world example.

    - Hbase
5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

    - NoSQL
6. Which type of database is best for scalability?

    - SQL
