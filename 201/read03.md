# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

## HTML Lists

1. **Unordered lists** should be used when the order of the list is purposeless and has no numerical ordering.
2. **Unordered lists** is not defined in HTML and instead should be assigned is an linked CSS page using the list-style-type property.
3. **Ordered list vx Unordered lists**and when to use them. You should use an ordered list over an unordered list when the order of the list is meaningful. If you can switch the order of your list and the meaning is not effected you should use an unordered list.
4. **List Items** numbers can be changed by using the *type* or *start* attributes inside the opening element.

## The Box Model: A Story About Margin and Padding

Padding and Margin have always been close friends but have never meet. How you say? They lived in tandem but were separated by a boarder which the could see and hear though but not pass through. So they have known each other forever but no matter how big or small they made themselves they could never achieve their dream of meeting in person as long as the impenetrable boarder still stands.

## 4 Parts of the Box Model

- Content box: The area where your content is displayed; size it using properties like inline-size and block-size or width and height.
- Padding box: The padding sits around the content as white space; size it using padding and related properties.
- Border box: The border box wraps the content and any padding; size it using border and related properties.
- Margin box: The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding, and border as whitespace between this box and other elements; size it using margin and related properties.

## Control Flow with JS

1. **Arrays** can store different data types like strings, numbers, objects, and even other arrays.
2. Yes **people** is a valid array in JS and you can access a stored value by doing *console.log(people[item index][item index]);*.
3. Five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript
    - Assignment: x = f() means	x = f()
    - Addition assignment:	x += f() means	x = x + f()
    - Subtraction assignment:	x -= f() means	x = x - f()
    - Multiplication assignment:	x *= f() means	x = x * f()
    - Division assignment:	x /= f() means	x = x / f()
4. It would produce *10dog* because you cannot add strings and numbers together.
5. **Conditionals** are pieces of code that makes decisions and carries out actions accordingly depending on different inputs. For example, in a game if the player's number of lives reaches 0, then the game is over.
6. A **Loop** is useful when you need to use the same code over and over again. Instead of writing it multiple times you can write is once and assign it a value to use later in your code.
