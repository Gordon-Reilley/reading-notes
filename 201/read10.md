# Debugging

## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript

1. Some key differences between a **Syntax Error** and a **Logic Error** are syntax errors are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through. Logical errors are where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results.
2. The most common error I encounter is not using a **";"** symbol to end a line of code. I have started to catch it much easier and have certainly stopped forgetting to use it because of simply repetition.
3. Being able to figure out and fix your code is half the battle of coding. This article will greatly affect my efficiency as a future software developer because the faster I can fix issues and get my code to run correctly the more of an asset I will be to a company.

## The JavaScript Debugger

1. **The JavaScript Debugger** allows you to watch the value of variables and set breakpoints, places in your code that you want to pause execution and identify the problems that prevent your code from executing properly.
2. A **breakpoint** is a place or places in your code that you want to pause execution.
3. The **Call stack** section shows you what code was executed to get to the current line. You can see that the code is in the function that handles a mouse click, and that the code is currently paused on the breakpoint.
