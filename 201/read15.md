# Quest to Build the Perfect Team

## Some things I learned about collaborating with others from this article

- Make suggestions not criticisms.
- Everyone wants to be heard so listen intently and don't always try to be the leader this is a shared group effort.
- Team-based work is only rising and becoming more prominent in companies because of more complex problems and projects.
- One of the best ways to improve groups is to influence "group norms" and not the actual people you put in groups together.
- One important trait of successful groups is "equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking" which basically means everyone should get roughly the same amount of time to speak.
- A Second trait of good teams is they all had high "average social sensitivity" a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues.
- Research on psychological safety pointed to particular norms that are vital to success. There are other behaviors
that are important as well, like making sure teams have clear goals and are creating a culture of dependability.

Overall  This was a very informative reading and I think will help all of us be better group-mates during project week.
