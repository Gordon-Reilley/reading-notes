# Images, Color, Text

## HTML Media

1. The real world use case for the **alt** attribute being used in a website is:
    - The user is visually impaired, and is using a screen reader to read the web out to them. In fact, having alt text available to describe images is useful to most users.
    - As described above, the spelling of the file or path name might be wrong.
    - The browser doesn't support the image type. Some people still use text-only browsers, such as Lynx, which displays the alt text of images.
    - You may want to provide text for search engines to utilize; for example, search engines can match alt text with search queries.
    - Users have turned off images to reduce data transfer volume and distractions. This is especially common on mobile phones, and in countries where bandwidth is limited or expensive.
2. I can improve the accessibility of images in HTML by including an src and alt in the img tag.
3. An example of when the **figure** element would be useful is to provide a semantic container for figures, and to clearly link the figure to the caption.
4. The difference between a **gif** and a **svg** image is svg images are  ideal for user interface elements, icons, diagrams. Where as a gif image is good choice for simple images and animations.
5. The image type that would best suit a screenshot is a PNG image.

1. The difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element is the foreground color is the HTML element's content and the background-color property defines the element's background color.
2. I would use attributes like color, background-color, text-decoration-color, and text-shadow to give my friend's page some character.
3. When choosing fonts for an HTML document I would consider using web safe fonts so my choice is reflected on all web systems and platforms. 
4. **font-size** changes the size of your text on a webpage. **font-weight** sets how bold the text is. **font-style** is used to turn italic text on or off.
5. Two ways that I could add spacing around the characters in an h1 element is letter-spacing and word-spacing properties.
