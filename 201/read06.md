# Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

## JavaScript Object Basics

1. An **object** is a collection of related data and/or functionality.
2. An **object literal** can give you advantages if you want to transfer a series of structured, related data items in some manner.
3. Objects differ from arrays because with an object  instead of using an index number to select an item, you are using the name associated with each member's value.
4. You would need to use **bracket notation** to access an objectâ€™s property instead of **dot notation** if an object property name is held in a variable, then you can't use dot notation to access the value, but you can access the value using bracket notation.
5. The **this** keyword refers to the current object the code is being written inside. Also, *this* enables you to use the same method definition for every object you create.

## Introduction To The DOM

1.The **DOM** (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects.
2. The relationship between the DOM and JavaScript is the DOM is not a programming language, but without it, the JavaScript language wouldn't have any model or notion of web pages, HTML documents, SVG documents, and their component parts.
