# Local Storage

## Local Storage and How To Use It On Websites

1. A developer would use local storage for a web application because you can keep updated states of a website for a user every time they come back to the website without making them sign in to a server.
2. Information that should not be stored in local storage is a users personal information.
3. Local storage can store strings in the different keys, but there is a workaround. You can work around this by using the native JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() methods.
