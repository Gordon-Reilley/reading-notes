# Read: Class 14 CSS & Psychological Safety

## CSS Transforms

1. A **CSS transform** allows the developer new ways to position and alter elements. General layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements.
2. An example of a transform and how I could see that being used on a website is by using the hover property to give an image or link more depth so a user would know this is and interactive website.

## CSS Transitions & Animations

1. A **CSS transition** allows the developer to have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.
2. A **CSS animation** differs from a CSS transition because transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.

## CSS3 Transitions continued

1. Some benefits to using CSS transitions on websites are it will excite your users, increase engagement and ultimately, when used well, increase your conversions.
2. This topic will fit in with my long-term goals because as a developer you can't overlook the importance of user interaction. With these new skills in transitions, animations, and transforms I will be able to greatly increase my ability to provide an interactive website.

## Quest to Build the Perfect Team

Some things I learned about collaborating with others from this article:

- Make suggestions not criticisms.
- Everyone wants to be heard so listen intently and don't always try to be the leader this is a shared group effort.
- Team-based work is only rising and becoming more prominent in companies because of more complex problems and projects.
- One of the best ways to improve groups is to influence "group norms" and not the actual people you put in groups together.
- One important trait of successful groups is "equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking" which basically means everyone should get roughly the same amount of time to speak.
- A Second trait of good teams is they all had high "average social sensitivity" a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues.
- Research on psychological safety pointed to particular norms that are vital to success. There are other behaviors
that are important as well, like making sure teams have clear goals and are creating a culture of dependability.

Overall  This was a very informative reading and I think will help all of us be better group-mates during project week.
