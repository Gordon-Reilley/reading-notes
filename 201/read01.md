## Getting Started

1. **HTTP Poem:** DSN (domain name system) is the server that finds the real address, HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) is the link between sever and client, and together they work to assemble a webpage so clients can be happy!
2. **Prasing:** HTML is prased first. Then the browser sends requests to the server for any CSS or JS files in order to prase those elements of the webpage.
3. **Images:** A person can find images for their website by looking them up on Google images and then right clicking the image and copying the image address or save the image to your computer. You will also want to choose an image with a creative commons license.
4. **String vs Number:** A string must be enclosed in a set of single or double quotes. A number do not have any quotes around them and are plainly written.
5. **Variable:** Variables are important because they allow you to assign something a value.

## Intro to HTML

1. **Attribute:** Attributes contain extra information about the element that won't appear in the content.
2. **Element Anatomy:** An element starts with an *opening tag* which consists of the name of the tag wrapped in brackets. Then you have your *content*. Lastly you follow your content with a closing tag, which is the same as an opening tag except it includes a forward slash.
3. **Article vs section:** The *section* tag defines a section in a document. The *article* tag specifies independent, self-contained content
4. **Typical elements for an HTML page:** DOCTYPE, html, head, meta, title, body.
5. **Metadata:** Metadata provides information about one or more aspects of other data. It is used to summarize basic information about data that can make tracking and working with specific data easier.
6. **Meta:** The meta tag is used by putting the specific content (metadata) within the tags after the element meta.

### How to Start a Website

1. The first step in starting a website is identifying what your project ideation is.
2. The most important question to answer when building a website is what do you want to accomplish?

### Semantics

1. **h1 vs span:** The *h1* element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role of a top level heading on your page. A *span* will look like a top level heading, but it has no semantic value, so it will not get any extra benefits. It is therefore a good idea to use the right HTML element for the right job.
2. **The Benefits of Using Semantics:**

- Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings (see SEO)
- Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page
Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classes
- Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated
- Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming

### What is Javascript?

1. 2 examples of things that require JS in the browser are interactive maps and animated 2D/3D graphics.
2. The way you add Javascript to an HTML document is by applying the *script* element to it. you can enclose your external JS file inside or write it all out within the HTML file itself.
