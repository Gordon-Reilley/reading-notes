# CSS Layout

## Learn CSS - Flexbox

1. **One-dimensional content** means taking a bunch of items which have different sizes, and returning the best layout for those items.
2. The difference between the main axis and cross axis is the main axis is the one set by your flex-direction property and cross axis runs in the other direction to the main axis, so if flex-direction is row the cross axis runs along the column.
3. Using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility because they do not wrap, they do not grow to fill the container, and they line up at the start of the container.

## CSS Layout - Flexbox

1. Some advantages of using flexbox over float:

    - Vertical centering  of block content inside its parent.
    - Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available.
    - Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.
2. This topic connects with my long term goals because I want to be efficient at CSS and flexbox seems like it will be an integral part of making well layed out webpages.
