# My Code Fellows Notebook

Hi, my name is **Gordon Reilley**. I love anything to do with technology or the outdoors! These are my collective notes for referencing when my human brain fails to remember the immense amount of information I learned while attending Code Fellows. Feel free to check them out and hopefully this accumulation of notes can help you like they have me.
