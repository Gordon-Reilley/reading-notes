# My Code Fellows Notebook

Hi, my name is **Gordon Reilley**. I love anything to do with technology or the outdoors!
After reading/listening to the article about growth mindset I realized I have some work to do. I feel a growth mindset is changing the way you think about what you are capable of. If you put in the work and believe you can accomplish a task, you will. There are people with natural affinities for skills, but that doesn't mean you cannot learn for them and eventually be on the same level as the people you once looked up to. 

### Growth mindset reminders
- No pain. No gain.
- Rememeber that I have the potential to achieve things I thought were out of my ability though perserverance.   
- Do not avoid challenges, embrace them.
